       "['The Taj Mahal (; lit.  \\'Crown of the Palace\\', [taːdʒ ˈmɛːɦ(ə)l]) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna  in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.\\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India\\'s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\\n\\n\\n== Inspiration ==\\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan\\'s grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun\\'s Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah\\'s Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan\\'s own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.\\n\\n\\n=== Tomb ===\\nThe tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.\\n\\nThe most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical \"drum\" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome). The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer\\'s penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets— a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.\\n\\n\\n=== Exterior decorations ===\\nThe exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs.\\nThroughout the complex are passages from the Qur\\'an that comprise some of the decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that Amanat Khan chose the passages.The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\" The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" upon him as a reward for his \"dazzling virtuosity.\" Near the lines from the Qur\\'an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi.\" Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate.Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.\\n\\n\\n=== Interior decoration ===\\nThe interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. Eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony\\'s exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in little detail, the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.\\n\\nMuslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. Mumtaz Mahal\\'s cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems. Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz. On the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet. Shah Jahan\\'s cenotaph is beside Mumtaz\\'s to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex. His cenotaph is bigger than his wife\\'s, but reflects the same elements: a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him. On the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box.The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively. The Ninety Nine Names of God are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include, \"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious... \". The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; \"He travelled from this world to the banquet-hall of Eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year 1076 Hijri.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Garden ===\\n\\nThe complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden.\\nThe garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning \\'walled garden.\\' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or \"Moonlight Garden\" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden\\'s design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan. Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees. As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the end of the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India, and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.\\n\\n\\n=== Outlying buildings ===\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan\\'s other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz\\'s favourite servant.The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb\\'s archways, and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab\\'s lack of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque\\'s wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer rugs in black marble. The mosque\\'s basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jahān-Numā, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.\\n\\n\\n== Construction ==\\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. It took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal. The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight. A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on \"completion\". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643 while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees, which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.\\n\\n\\n== Later days ==\\nAbdul Hamid Lahauri in his book Badshahnama refers to Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.\\nSoon after the Taj Mahal\\'s completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Upon Shah Jahan\\'s death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife. In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal, the two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph, were taken away by them, along with the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque. During this time the garden was remodelled with European-style lawns that are still in place today.\\n\\n\\n== Threats ==\\n\\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.More recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the Yamuna River including acid rain due to the Mathura Oil Refinery, which was opposed by Supreme Court of India directives. The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow-brown. To help control the pollution, the Indian government has set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.Concerns for the tomb\\'s structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around 1.5 m (5 ft) per year. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water. It has been pointed out by politicians, however, that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake. In 2011, it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years.Small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on April 11, 2018. On 31 May 2020 another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex.\\n\\n\\n== Tourism ==\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001, which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for Indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1,100 INR. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre. In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.\\nForeign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, George Harrison, Barack and Michelle Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana and Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\n== Myths ==\\n\\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument. A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan\\'s obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself. Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India. A+E Television Network. 2006.No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings. No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck\\'s biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck\\'s fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.In 2000, India\\'s Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak\\'s petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal. In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 1196.A theory that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work Itinerario, (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nAs of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N.  Oak\\'s theory. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple. Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government\\'s union minister of culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book \"Taj Mahal: The True Story\". He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI. Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan stated Taj might be destroyed like Babri Masjid as people believed there was a temple there. Katiyar called for the demolition of the Taj and its replacement by a temple in February 2018. In response Indian National Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called him a troglodyte.A controversy was created in 2017 when the Uttar Pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet \"Uttar Pradesh Tourism - Unlimited Possibilities\". The chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent Indian culture. Amidst this controversy, BJP MLA Sangeet Som had claimed that the those who built the Taj Mahal were traitors and it was a \"blot\" on the country\\'s culture. He claimed it was built by a man who jailed his own father and wished to kill Hindus. BJP MP Anshul Verma supported his comments. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah and Azam Khan criticised him. CM Adityanath stated Som\\'s comments were personal and the government will focus on the tourism potential of every monument.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\nTaj Mahal\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWonders of the World\\nNew7Wonders of the World\\nArchitecture of India\\nFatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\\nBibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\\nTaj Mahal replicas and derivatives\\nList of tallest domes\\nInside, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Taj Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\\n Quotations related to Taj Mahal at Wikiquote\\n Taj Mahal travel guide from Wikivoyage\\nOfficial website of the Taj Mahal\\nDescription of the Taj Mahal at the Archaeological Survey of India\\nProfile of the Taj Mahal at UNESCO',\n",
       " 'The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 19 September 2020, more than 30.5 million cases have been reported in 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 952,000 deaths; more than 20.7 million people have recovered.\\n\\nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days. There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy. There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering mouth when coughing, social distancing, wearing a face mask in public, disinfecting surfaces, ventilating and air-filtering, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they may be infected. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures to slow the spread of the disease. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.\\nThe pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. According to estimations, up to 100 million people have fallen into extreme poverty and global famines are affecting 130 million people. It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Educational institutions have been partially or fully closed, with many switching to online schooling. Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.\\n\\n\\n== Epidemiology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Background ===\\nOn 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020. On 30 January, with 7,818 confirmed cases across 19 countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).Several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market; the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin. The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin. The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market. On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected. Phylogenic estimates in genetic studies conducted in early 2020 indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely jumped into the human population sometime between 6 October 2019 and 11 December 2019.The WHO recognised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging numbers of cases. Later that month, the number of cases outside of China quickly surpassed the number of cases inside China.\\n\\n\\n=== Cases ===\\n\\nOfficial case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols. Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases. Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies. Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported. Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20. It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested. A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5, but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9). R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Deaths ===\\n\\nMost people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days. As of 19 September 2020, approximately 952,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June, about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Individuals of any age with COPD, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other underlying health conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. In August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 94 percent of COVID-19 death certificates listed at least one comorbidity. The reported comorbidities include symptoms caused by COVID-19 infection which contributed to the fatality in addition to pre-existing health conditions. On 92% of American death certificates listing COVID-19 as a cause of death, COVID-19 was listed as “the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death”.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020. The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first reported death outside Asia was in France on 14 February. Post-mortem analysis of tissue samples has identified earlier deaths due to COVID-19 which went undetected at the time, including a California woman who died on February 6.Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested. Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting. Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries. In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal. This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality. These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health. Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 3.1 percent (952,577 deaths for 30,536,424 cases) as of 19 September 2020. The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known. In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China. The University of Oxford\\'s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics. Another paper in PLOS Medicine estimated IFR across several areas in Europe ranging from 0.4-1.6%.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Duration ===\\nOn 11 March 2020, the WHO said the pandemic could be controlled. The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, \"Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it\\'s almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be.\" The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required \"until a vaccine becomes available. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is \"so readily transmissible\", it \"might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year\". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nThe usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days. Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible. As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.\\n\\n\\n== Cause ==\\n\\n\\n=== Transmission ===\\n\\n\\n=== Virology ===\\n\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.SARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV, and is thought to have a zoonotic origin. SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus.\\n\\n\\n== Diagnosis ==\\n\\nCOVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.\\n\\n\\n=== Viral testing ===\\nThe standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new \"spit test\" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs and could enable people to conduct it at home.\\n\\n\\n=== Imaging ===\\n\\nCharacteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions. Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.\\n\\n\\n== Prevention ==\\n\\nStrategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public. Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak. The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective. There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.\\n\\n\\n=== Hand washing ===\\n\\nHand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one\\'s nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. In addition, soap and water disrupts the sticky bond between pathogens and human skin which causes the coronavirus pathogen to slide off the hands/body. CDC has recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available. The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.\\n\\n\\n=== Social distancing ===\\n\\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak. Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10. On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.\\n\\n\\n=== Face masks and respiratory hygiene ===\\n\\nThe CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.\\n\\n\\n=== Self-isolation ===\\n\\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.\\n\\n\\n=== Surface cleaning ===\\nSurfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used. The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.\\n\\n\\n=== Ventilation and air filtration ===\\nThe CDC recommends ventilation in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols, as well several others, including those regarding air filtration; however, doctors have been cautious about recommending air filtration due to the potentially very small size of virus particles. Some filters are labelled to remove viruses to the 5-micron level, but there are fears that some virus particles may be even smaller. Some experts have recommended UV light inside HVAC systems.\\n\\n\\n=== Vaccine ===\\n\\n\\n== Management ==\\n\\n\\n=== Screening, containment and mitigation ===\\n\\nStrategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus. Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time. Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve. This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed. Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans. Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.\\n\\n\\n==== Contact tracing ====\\n\\nContact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission. The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user\\'s proximity to other cellphones. (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography. The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms. In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.\\n\\n\\n=== Health care ===\\n\\nIncreasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure. The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds. In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts. In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight. On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.\\n\\n\\n=== Treatment ===\\n\\nAntiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19, though none have yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials. However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus. Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19. The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms. Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required. The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it. On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support, though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes. Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint. On 2 September, the WHO recommended treatment with systemic steroids for patients with severe and critical symptoms, but continued to advise against their use for other patients.A study of major hospitals in the U.S. found that abnormal liver tests occurred in most hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Tocilizumab was significantly associated in the relationship between the drugs used to treat the disease and abnormal liver tests, which prompted studies to determine whether abnormal results were due to coronavirus or drug-induced liver injury, according to Michael Nathanson, director of the Yale Liver Center and co-author of the study.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2019 ===\\n\\nThere are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated. According to Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province. There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them was \"patient zero.\" Based on the retrospective analysis, starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals. However, in May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.On 30 December 2019, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours; and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\". The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases—enough to trigger an investigation.\\n\\n\\n=== 2020 ===\\n\\nDuring the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange. On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen. A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later) and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China. As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic. On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths. By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported, the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June. As of 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed. Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus is still accelerating as countries reopen their economies, although many countries have made progress in slowing down the spread.On 15 July 2020, one COVID-19 case was officially reported in Dalian in more than three months. The patient did not travel outside the city in the 14 days before developing symptoms, nor did he have contact with people from \"areas of attention.\"As of 19 September 2020, more than 30.5 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 952,000 people have died and more than 20.7 million have recovered.\\n\\n\\n== National responses ==\\n\\nA total of 188 countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls. National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world\\'s population.By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America. Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, around 100 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India. On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 million cases were surpassed.\\n\\n\\n=== Asia ===\\n\\nAs of 19 May 2020, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases. Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly Mongolia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, has allowed them to fare comparatively well.\\n\\n\\n==== China ====\\n\\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus. A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases, and WHO investigated the outbreak on 1 January 2020. As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for \"spreading rumours\" about the outbreak. The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no \"clear evidence\" of human-to-human transmission, but privately Chinese officials said on 14 January that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed.On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus. That same day, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel. During the Chinese New Year (25 January) travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown. On 10 February, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a \"people\\'s war\" to contain the viral spread. In \"the largest quarantine in human history\", a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan, then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 million people. Private vehicle use was banned in the city. Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled. Authorities announced the construction of temporary hospitals, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in ten days, and Leishenshan Hospital, while other facilities in Wuhan were also converted into temporary hospitals.\\n A further series of measures were instituted by the authorities in late February to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday, travel restrictions, and closure of museums, universities and schools around the country. The regions of Hong Kong and Macao instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities. Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction. In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs. Many of China\\'s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 24 March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China. The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, and those wishing to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates. The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4 April, coinciding with the Qingming Festival. On 25 April, the last patients were discharged in Wuhan. Local lockdowns, however, were later implemented to control sporadic outbreaks of the disease, for example in the city of Jilin in May, and parts of Beijing in June.\\n\\n\\n==== India ====\\n\\nThe first case of COVID-19 in India originated from China and was reported on 30 January 2020. India ordered a nationwide lockdown for the entire population starting 24 March, with a phased unlock beginning 1 June. Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country—Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.As of May 2020, India had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia; as of August 2020, behind the United States and Brazil, India had the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May and 2,000,000 confirmed cases on 6 August 2020.On 10 June, India\\'s recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time. As of 30 August, India\\'s case fatality rate is relatively low at 2.3%, against the global 4.7%.\\n\\n\\n==== Iran ====\\n\\nIran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infections on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day. Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, Friday prayers, and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools. Iran allocated 5 trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus. President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined. Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued. Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February. More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date. The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March. On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began. At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March. By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus. According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country\\'s financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak. On 20 April, Iran reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country. After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June, raising fear of a second wave. On 18 July, President Rouhani estimated that 25 million Iranians had already become infected, which is considerably higher than the official count. Leaked data suggest that 42,000 people had died with COVID-19 symptoms by 20 July, nearly tripling the 14,405 officially reported by that date.\\n\\n\\n==== South Korea ====\\n\\nCOVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation\\'s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak. By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020. On 29 February, more than 3,150 confirmed cases were reported. All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus. Airline schedules were also changed.\\n\\nSouth Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them. Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day. Despite some early criticisms of President Moon Jae-in\\'s response to the crisis, South Korea\\'s programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks. On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks. Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries. Persistent local groups of infections in the greater Seoul area continued to be found, which led to Korea\\'s CDC director saying in June that the country had entered a second wave of infections, although a WHO official disagreed with that assessment.\\n\\n\\n=== Europe ===\\n\\nOn 21 August, it was reported the COVID-19 cases were climbing among younger individuals across Europe.\\n\\n\\n==== France ====\\n\\nAlthough it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples. A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places, and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May. As of 14 September, France has reported more than 402,000 confirmed cases, 30,000 deaths, and 90,000 recoveries, ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases. In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs. On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.\\n\\n\\n==== Italy ====\\n\\nThe outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 in Rome. Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency. An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.\\n\\nOn 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, \"In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas.\"On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month. On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols. On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic. On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy. As of 14 September, there were 287,753 confirmed cases, 35,610 deaths, and 213,634 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region. A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy\\'s large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate. On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.\\n\\n\\n==== Spain ====\\n\\n\\n==== Sweden ====\\n\\nSweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open. Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency\\'s policy favoured forgoing a lockdown. The Swedish strategy focused on measures that could be put in place over a longer period of time, based on the assumption that the virus would start spreading again after a shorter lockdown. The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping. On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day. In the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.\\n\\n\\n==== United Kingdom ====\\n\\nThe nature of devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of the four countries of the UK had its own response to COVID-19 with different rules and restrictions at different times and the UK government, on behalf of England, moving more quickly to lift restrictions. The UK government started to implement forms of social distancing and mass quarantine measures on 18 March 2020 and was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres. On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers\\' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment.On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for those deemed \"essential\", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.\\n\\nOn 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government pledged more than £50 million towards research. To ensure UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built. The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days. On 4 May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities; Nightingale had \"treated 51 patients\" in the first three weeks it was open.On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.\\n\\n\\n=== North America ===\\n\\n\\n==== United States ====\\n\\nOn 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who returned from Wuhan on 15 January. On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency. On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit. The United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak, marred by defective tests produced by the government in February, lack of federal approval for non-government kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test.By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, half of them in California. Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Mike Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small. On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak. Corporations encouraged employees to work from home. Sports events and seasons were cancelled.\\n\\nOn 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis. Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours and schools across the country were shutting down. By 17 March, the epidemic was confirmed in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country. U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting \"severe shortages\" of test supplies, \"widespread shortages\" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.\\n\\nOn 22 April, it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6 and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged. By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died. As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died. The Times said that prior to 29 April only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria included probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., with about 4.25 percent of the world\\'s population, had about 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus deaths.The White House was criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling messaging, directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements with the office of Vice-President Pence. On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they mismanaged the pandemic. On 1 May the CDC presented a 17-page report to the administration, written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they reopened. The White House refused to use the report, and Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting \"I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was.\"By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other businesses, placing limits on the numbers of people allowed in at one time. The head of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed disapproval of Fauci\\'s statements, saying \"To me it\\'s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.\" By mid-June, new cases began to rise again, with increases in the percent of positive tests and number of hospitalizations in states such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona. On 12 July, almost 6 months after the first case was recognised in the U.S., the highest single-day case record of 15,300 infections were recorded in Florida.On 6 July 2020, President Trump\\'s administration sent a notice to United Nations Secretary General António Guterres that they would withdraw from the World Health Organization, effective 6 July 2021, under the terms of a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1948 which requires the U.S. to give one-year notice and clear its debts to leave the WHO. On 16 July, the U.S. set a record for the most cases in a single day with more than 75,000 confirmed infections of COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n=== South America ===\\n\\n\\n==== Brazil ====\\n\\nOn 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States. On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a \"little flu\" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. President Donald Trump he has been called the \"Trump of the Tropics\". Bolsonaro later tested positive for the virus.In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil\\'s health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of the previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths. On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.\\n\\n\\n=== Africa ===\\n\\n\\n=== Oceania ===\\n\\nOn 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously.\\n\\n\\n== International responses ==\\n\\n\\n=== Travel restrictions ===\\n\\nAs a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, or for all travellers. Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19. A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions. Researchers concluded that \"travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic\" and \"restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late\".The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy, a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.\\n\\n\\n=== Evacuation of foreign citizens ===\\n\\nOwing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens. Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people. On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk. Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship. In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n=== International aid ===\\n\\n\\n=== United Nations response measures ===\\n\\nThe United Nations has coordinated the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, led by its Secretary-General. The response can be divided into formal resolutions at the General Assembly and at the Security Council (UNSC), and operations via its specialized agencies, chiefly the World Health Organization in the initial stages, but involving more humanitarian-oriented agencies, like UNICEF, the International Labour Organization, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as the humanitarian impact became clearer, and then economic organizations, like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, as the socioeconomic implications worsened. In June 2020, the Secretary-General launched its \\'UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19\\'. The UNSC has been criticized for a slow coordinated response, especially regarding the UN\\'s global ceasefire, which aims to open up humanitarian access to the world\\'s most vulnerable in conflict zones.\\n\\n\\n==== WHO response measures ====\\n\\nTaiwan posted an inquiry to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing \"regular updates,\" contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy. The WHO said on 5 January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported, and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks. though in public announcements it said there was \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\" as late as 14 January. On 20 January, the WHO said it was \"now very clear\" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected. On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be \"high at the global level.\"On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation, and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus, following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to \"the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems,\" but that the WHO did not \"recommend limiting trade and movement.\"On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the \"power of the entire UN system in the response.\" A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO said will allow them to \"focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak\". On 25 February, the WHO declared \"the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic,\" stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be \"in a phase of preparedness.\" On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from \"high\" to \"very high\", its highest level of alert and risk assessment. On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The Director-General said the WHO was \"deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction\". Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the PHEIC and pandemic classification came too late. The third meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on 30 April renewed the declaration of PHEIC for the second time.\\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\n\\n\\n=== Economics ===\\n\\nThe outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world\\'s supply chain that could last up to two years. Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China. On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08) and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent. On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China\\'s sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook. Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.Lloyd\\'s of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.\\n\\nTourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed. The cruise line industry was hard hit, and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed. International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures. Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop. This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.\\n\\nHundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally. More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims. The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the pandemic has raised fears of a mass eviction crisis, with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating between 30–40 million Americans are at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic. According to the World Bank, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into extreme poverty due to the shutdowns.\\n\\n\\n==== Supply shortages ====\\n\\nThe outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to the factory and logistic operations. The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust). The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods. According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months. It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, is one of the leading suppliers. Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK. U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said \"we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.\" Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.\\n\\n\\n==== Oil and other energy markets ====\\nIn early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \"scrambled\" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China. On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders\\' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs. June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.\\n\\n\\n=== Culture ===\\n\\nThe performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations\\' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.\\n\\nHoly Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled. Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship. With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter\\'s Square emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras. Iran\\'s Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina. The 2020 Hajj was limited to around 1,000 selected pilgrims, in contrast to the usual number of over 2 million.The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 NHL season. The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which were originally scheduled to start at 24 July 2020, and were postponed by the International Olympic Committee to 23 July 2021.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours. The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May, was cancelled; however, the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021. Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances. Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based \"festivals\" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work. Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\n\\nThe pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities, isolations or deaths of multiple politicians, and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.\\nStarting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus.Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries. Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.The measures taken to combat the pandemic are part of an unusually large expansion of government power. Advocates of small government worry that the state will be reluctant to give up that power once the crisis is over, as has often been the case historically.On 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres issued an appeal for a global ceasefire in response to the pandemic; 172 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal in June, and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July.\\n\\n\\n==== China ====\\n\\nThe Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government, UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and others for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy. The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases. The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.\\n\\n\\n==== Italy ====\\nIn early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union\\'s lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy—Maurizio Massari, Italy\\'s ambassador to the EU, said \"only China responded bilaterally\", not the EU. On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy. President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid. Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary.\"\\nIn early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant, and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.\\n\\n\\n==== United States ====\\n\\nThe outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health. Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump\\'s chances of re-election. Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association. Simultaneously, protests ensued by essential workers in the form of a general strike.\\n\\n\\n==== Other countries ====\\nThe planned NATO \"Defender 2020\" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament\\'s general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying \"it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.\"The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected. Iran\\'s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran. Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic. South Korea criticised Japan\\'s \"ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts\" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites. South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in\\'s response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon\\'s impeachment or praising his response.Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power. In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic. In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government\\'s handling of the crisis. In some countries, including Egypt, Turkey, and Thailand, opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\\n=== Famine ===\\n\\nThe pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis \"of biblical proportions,\" or \"hunger pandemic.\" It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that \"12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger\" by the end of 2020.\\nThis pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.\\n55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario. 265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\n\\n\\n=== Other health issues ===\\n\\n\\n=== Environment and climate ===\\n\\n\\n=== Xenophobia and racism ===\\n\\nSince the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent. Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus. Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults. U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Kung Flu\", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese. On March 14, an Asian family, including a two-year-old girl, was attacked at knifepoint in Texas in what the FBI has called a COVID-19 related hate crime.Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group\\'s gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread. Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown. Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. South Korea\\'s LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul. In China, some people of African descent  were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus. This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.\\n\\n\\n== Information dissemination ==\\n\\nOngoing COVID-19 research is indexed and searchable in the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio. Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts, while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access. Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.\\n\\n\\n=== Misinformation ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nEmerging infectious disease\\nGlobalisation and disease\\nList of epidemics and pandemics\\nTimeline of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\\n=== Health agencies ===\\nCOVID-19 (Questions & Answers, instructional videos; Facts/MythBusters) by the World Health Organization\\nCOVID-19 by the Government of Canada\\nCOVID-19 by the National Health Commission, China\\nCOVID-19 (Q&A) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\\nCOVID-19 (Q&A) by the Ministry of Health, Singapore\\nCOVID-19 (Q&A) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\\nNIH COVID-19 Portfolio by the U.S. National Institutes of Health\\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (Q&A) by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\\n\\n\\n=== Directories ===\\nCOVID-19 Directory on Curlie\\nCOVID-19 Resource Directory on OpenMD\\n\\n\\n=== Data and graphs ===\\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and map by the World Health Organization\\nCoronavirus Resource Center, map, and historical data by Johns Hopkins University\\nHistorical data about COVID-19 cases published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)\\nWorld Travel Restrictions based on WFP data\\nCoronavirus Observer based on Johns Hopkins University data\\nCOVID-19 coronavirus pandemic published by Worldometer\\nCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Statistics and Research published by Our World in Data\\nCOVID-19 Projections for many countries published by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\\nSpreadsheets: Country comparisons\\nSpreadsheets: Historical data with additional computations\\nEpidemic Calculator\\nStat News COVID-19 Tracker\\n\\n\\n=== Medical journals ===\\nCoronavirus: News and Resources by BMJ Publishing Group\\nNovel Coronavirus Information Center by Elsevier\\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by JAMA\\nCOVID-19 Resource Centre by The Lancet\\nSARS‑CoV‑2 and COVID-19 by Nature\\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) by The New England Journal of Medicine\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (2019-20) Collection by PLOS\\nCOVID-19: Novel Coronavirus by Wiley Publishing',\n",
       " 'Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match\\'s statistical information.\\nForms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.\\nThe earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game\\'s governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game\\'s rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies. Women\\'s cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\n\\nCricket is one of many games in the \"club ball\" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In cricket\\'s case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a \"wicket gate\" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend. The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three \"groups\" of \"club ball\" games: the \"hockey group\", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the \"golf group\", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the \"cricket group\", in which \"the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it\".It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children\\'s game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:\\nBeing a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.\\nGiven Derrick\\'s age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey. The view that it was originally a children\\'s game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave\\'s 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\" and the verb form \"crosser\" as \"to play at cricket\".One possible source for the sport\\'s name is the Old English word \"cryce\" (or \"cricc\") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson\\'s Dictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\". In Old French, the word \"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) \"krick\"(-e), meaning a stick (crook). Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\"). Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.\\n\\n\\n=== Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England ===\\n\\nAlthough the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects. The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.In 1611, the year Cotgrave\\'s dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance. This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century. It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth. The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after the Restoration\" in 1660. Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population. Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players. By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676. A 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the \"gentry\", began to classify themselves as \"amateurs\" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities. The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their \"social inferiors\" if they were to win their bets. In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were \"officers and gentlemen\" whose destiny was to provide leadership. In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term \"shamateur\" was coined to describe the practice.\\n\\n\\n=== English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries ===\\n\\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England\\'s national sport. Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting. Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape.The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord\\'s Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game\\'s greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport\\'s premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839. In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, de facto professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.The last two decades before the First World War have been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.\\n\\n\\n=== Cricket becomes an international sport ===\\n\\nMeanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand, North America and South Africa. In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour.In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia. The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket\\'s most famous contest. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.\\n\\n\\n=== World cricket in the 20th century ===\\n\\nThe inter-war years were dominated by Australia\\'s Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batsman of all time. Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before the Second World War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland and Afghanistan (both 2018) in the post-war period. South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott.\\n\\n\\n=== The rise of limited overs cricket ===\\nCricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an immediate impact. On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to play Test cricket.\\n\\n\\n== Laws and gameplay ==\\n\\nIn cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called \"the Laws\") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital \"L\"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Playing area ===\\n\\nCricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each. The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart. The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.\\n\\nAs illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.\\n\\n\\n=== Match structure and closure ===\\n\\nBefore a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings. Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match. In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run, in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs, though this does not apply in international cricket. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn. If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have \"lost by n runs\" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by n wickets\", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents\\' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batsmen have been dismissed) have won the match \"by four wickets\".In a two-innings-a-side match, one team\\'s combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side\\'s first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have \"won by an innings and n runs\", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams\\' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue. There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.\\n\\n\\n==== Innings ====\\n\\nThe innings (ending with \\'s\\' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in\". In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.\\nAn innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:\\nthe batting team\\'s captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings\\nthe set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled\\nthe match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time\\nin the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.\\n\\n\\n===== Overs =====\\n\\nThe Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\". The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\". The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker\\'s end and vice versa.\\n\\n\\n=== Clothing and equipment ===\\n\\nThe wicket-keeper (a specialized fielder behind the batsman) and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper\\'s gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.\\n\\n\\n==== Bat and ball ====\\n\\nThe essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat, is \"on strike\" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay).\\nThe bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable;  during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball\\'s behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball\\'s swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering.\\n\\n\\n=== Player roles ===\\n\\n\\n==== Basic gameplay: bowler to batsman ====\\nDuring normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.\\nIn the photo, the two batsmen (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6). Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler\\'s (4) end of the pitch. The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batsman (8) at the other end who is called the \"striker\". The other batsman (3) at the bowling end is called the \"non-striker\". The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker\\'s wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called \"first slip\" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).\\nWhile the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler\\'s end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called \"square leg\", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker\\'s end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.\\nSome players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either or these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termed all-rounders.  Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or spinners. Batsmen are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.\\n\\n\\n==== Fielding ====\\n\\nOf the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket. The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return. The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.\\n\\n\\n==== Bowling and dismissal ====\\n\\nMost bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally. The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\". Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder. At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often \"buy his wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be \"trapped\" into getting himself out. In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman\\'s concentration.There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare. The common forms of dismissal are bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped. Rare methods are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, handled the ball and timed out. The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision. If the batsman is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says \"Out!\"; otherwise, he will shake his head and say \"Not out\". There is, effectively, an eleventh method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.\\n\\n\\n==== Batting, runs and extras ====\\n\\nBatsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team. Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.A skilled batsman can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat\\'s blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an \"edge\". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman\\'s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".The batsman on strike (i.e. the \"striker\") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.\\n\\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball\\'s progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batsmen do not need to run. Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team\\'s total.Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules; wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman\\'s reach; bye, an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way; leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman\\'s body, though not his bat. If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.\\n\\n\\n==== Specialist roles ====\\n\\nThe captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves \"within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws\".The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the \"keeper\") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour. He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.\\n\\n\\n=== Umpires and scorers ===\\n\\nThe game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler\\'s end, the other in a position called \"square leg\" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How\\'s that?\" or \"Owzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.A match\\'s statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches. According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use. It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord\\'s for the first time in 1846.\\n\\n\\n=== Spirit of the Game ===\\n\\nBesides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the \"Spirit of Cricket,\" which is the \"Preamble to the Laws,\" first published in the 2000 code, and updated in 2017, and now opens with this statement:\\n\"Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket\".\\nThe Preamble is a short statement that emphasises the \"Positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork.\"The major responsibility for ensuring fair play is placed firmly on the captains, but extends to all players, umpires, teachers, coaches, and parents involved.\\nThe umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.\\nPrevious versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batsman is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship – or its absence.\\n\\n\\n== Women\\'s cricket ==\\n\\nWomen\\'s cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745. International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934. The following year, New Zealand women joined them, and in 2007 Netherlands women became the tenth women\\'s Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa women. In 1958, the International Women\\'s Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005). In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women\\'s World Cup was held in England.  In 2005, the International Women\\'s Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women\\'s Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women\\'s cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC\\'s decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women\\'s rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and T20I lists.\\n\\n\\n== Governance ==\\n\\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989. The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket\\'s major international tournaments, notably the men\\'s and women\\'s versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\\nEach member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.The table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:\\n\\n\\n== Types of match ==\\n\\nCricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket. The highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital \"T\") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each. There are two types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.\\n\\n\\n== Competitions ==\\nCricket is played at both the international and domestic level. There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats. There are now a number of T20 leagues, which have spawned a \"T20 freelancer\" phenomenon.\\n\\n\\n=== International competitions ===\\n\\nMost international matches are played as parts of \\'tours\\', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes.\\nThe ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the 2020–22 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020. The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.\\nCompetitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier.\\n\\n\\n=== National competitions ===\\n\\n\\n==== First-class ====\\n\\nFirst-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019.Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. New South Wales has the highest number of titles.\\nThe other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League (Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).\\n\\n\\n==== Limited overs ====\\n\\n\\n==== Other ====\\n\\n\\n=== Club and school cricket ===\\n\\nThe world\\'s earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a \"cricketing\" of \"the Weald and the Upland\" versus \"the Chalk Hill\" at Chevening \"about thirty years since\" (i.e., c.\\u20091611). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.At the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening. Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular. Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events. The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\n\\n=== Influence on everyday life ===\\nCricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as \"that\\'s not cricket\" (that\\'s unfair), \"had a good innings\" (lived a long life) and \"sticky wicket\". \"On a sticky wicket\" (aka \"sticky dog\" or \"glue pot\") is a metaphor used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.\\n\\n\\n=== In the arts and popular culture ===\\n\\nCricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron. Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written.\\n\\nIn the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler\\'s Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale\\'s The Cricketers (1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\" French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion. Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan\\'s cricket images are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail\\'s \"World of Invention\" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\\n\\n\\n=== Influence on other sports ===\\nCricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports. In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game. It is typically played on modified cricket fields.In England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months. Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884; Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams. Sheffield United\\'s Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the Clipper. The statistical record is so central to the game\\'s \"historical essence\" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as \"the Father of Baseball\" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nGlossary of cricket terms\\nStreet cricket\\nBete-ombro - Brazilian version\\nPlaquita - Dominican versionRelated sports\\n\\nBaseball\\nComparison of baseball and cricket\\nStoolball\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n== General sources ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nGuha, Ramachandra (2002).

       " 'Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.\\nData science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods\" in order to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.\\n\\n\\n== Foundations ==\\nData science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data). The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship to statistics ===\\nMany statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data. Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action. Andrew Gelman of Columbia University and data scientist Vincent Granville have described statistics as a nonessential part of data science.\\nStanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics. \\nIn summary, data science can be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early usage ===\\nIn 1962, John Tukey described a field he called “data analysis,” which resembles modern data science. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.The term “data science” has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. In 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data. In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included “knowledge discovery” and “data mining.”\\n\\n\\n=== Modern usage ===\\nThe modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name. \"Data science\" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science. In 2014, the American Statistical Association\\'s Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.The professional title of “data scientist” has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report, \"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century,\" it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.\\n\\n\\n== Careers in data science ==\\nData science is a growing field. A career as a data scientist is ranked at the third best job in America for 2020 by Glassdoor, and was ranked the number one best job from 2016-2019.\\n\\n\\n=== Educational path ===\\nIn order to become a data scientist, there is a significant amount of education and experience required. The first step in becoming a data scientist is to earn a bachelor\\'s degree, typically in a quantitative field. Coding bootcamps are also available and can be used as an alternate pre-qualification to supplement a bachelor\\'s degree. Most data scientists also complete a master’s degree or a PhD in a quantitative/scientific field. Once these qualifications are met, the next step to becoming a data scientist is to apply for an entry-level job in the field. Some data scientists may later choose to specialize in a sub-field of data science.\\n\\n\\n=== Specializations and associated careers ===\\nMachine Learning Scientist: Machine learning scientists research new methods of data analysis and create algorithms.\\nData Engineer: Data Engineers prepare the “big data” infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are software engineers who design, build, integrate data from various resources, and manage big data.\\nData Analyst: Data analysts utilize large data sets to gather information that meets their company’s needs.\\nData Consultant: Data consultants work with businesses to determine the best usage of the information yielded from data analysis.\\nData Architect: Data architects build data solutions that are optimized for performance and design applications.\\nApplications Architect: Applications architects track how applications are used throughout a business and how they interact with users and other applications.\\n\\n\\n== Impacts of data science ==\\nBig data is very quickly becoming a vital tool for businesses and companies of all sizes. The availability and interpretation of big data has altered the business models of old industries and enabled the creation of new ones. Data-driven businesses are worth $1.2 trillion collectively in 2020, an increase from $333 billion in the year 2015. Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations.

inspiration for the taj mahal architecture and design the taj mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of persian and earlier mughal architecture specific inspiration came from successful timurid and mughal buildings including the gur amir the tomb of timur progenitor of the mughal dynasty in samarkand humayun is tomb which inspired the charbagh gardens and hasht behesht architecture plan of the site itmad ud daulah is tomb sometimes called the baby taj and shah jahan is own jama masjid in delhi while earlier mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone shah jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi precious stones buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement tomb the tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the taj mahal it is large white marble structure standing on square plinth and consists of symmetrical building with an iwan an arch shaped doorway topped by large dome and finial like most mughal tombs the basic elements are persian in origin the base structure is large multi chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight sided structure that is approximately metres ft on each of the four long sides each side of the iwan is framed with huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side this motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building four minarets frame the tomb one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners the main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of mumtaz mahal and shah jahan the actual graves are at lower level the most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb the dome is nearly metres ft high which is close in measurement to the length of the base and accentuated by the cylindrical drum it sits on which is approximately metres ft high because of its shape the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud guava dome the top is decorated with lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height the shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris kiosks placed at its corners which replicate the onion shape of the main dome the dome is slightly asymmetrical their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior tall decorative spires guldastas extend from edges of base walls and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome the lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas the dome and chattris are topped by gilded finial which mixes traditional persian and hindustani decorative elements the main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by copy made of gilded bronze in the early century this feature provides clear example of integration of traditional persian and hindu decorative elements the finial is topped by moon typical islamic motif whose horns point heavenward the minarets which are each more than metres ft tall display the designer is penchant for symmetry they were designed as working minarets traditional element of mosques used by the muezzin to call the islamic faithful to prayer each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower at the top of the tower is final balcony surmounted by chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb the chattris all share the same decorative elements of lotus design topped by gilded finial the minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb exterior decorations the exterior decorations of the taj mahal are among the finest in mughal architecture as the surface area changes the decorations are refined proportionally the decorative elements were created by applying paint stucco stone inlays or carvings in line with the islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy abstract forms or vegetative motifs throughout the complex are passages from the qur an that comprise some of the decorative elements recent scholarship suggests that amanat khan chose the passages the calligraphy on the great gate reads soul thou art at rest return to the lord at peace with him and he at peace with you the calligraphy was created in by calligrapher named abdul haq shah jahan conferred the title of amanat khan upon him as reward for his dazzling virtuosity near the lines from the qur an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription written by the insignificant being amanat khan shirazi much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below the calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate abstract forms are used throughout especially in the plinth minarets gateway mosque jawab and to lesser extent on the surfaces of the tomb the domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements white inlays are used in sandstone buildings and dark or black inlays on the white marbles mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in contrasting colour which creates complex array of geometric patterns floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns on the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines the marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings the dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised almost geometric vines flowers and fruits the inlay stones are of yellow marble jasper and jade polished and levelled to the surface of the walls interior decoration the interior chamber of the taj mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements the inlay work is not pietra dura but lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones the inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face although only the door facing the garden to the south is used the interior walls are about metres ft high and are topped by false interior dome decorated with sun motif eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and as with the exterior each lower pishtaq is crowned by second pishtaq about midway up the wall the four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas and each balcony is exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble in addition to the light from the balcony screens light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners the octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work the remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi precious stones forming twining vines fruits and flowers each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas relief intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect in little detail the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves hence the bodies of mumtaz and shah jahan were put in relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right towards mecca mumtaz mahal is cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on rectangular marble base of by metres ft in by ft in both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise mumtaz on the lid of the casket is raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest writing tablet shah jahan is cenotaph is beside mumtaz is to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex his cenotaph is bigger than his wife is but reflects the same elements larger casket on slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him on the lid of the casket is traditional sculpture of small pen box the pen box and writing tablet are traditional mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively the ninety nine names of god are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of mumtaz mahal other inscriptions inside the crypt include noble magnificent majestic unique eternal glorious the tomb of shah jahan bears calligraphic inscription that reads he travelled from this world to the banquet hall of eternity on the night of the twenty sixth of the month of rajab in the year hijri garden the complex is set around large ft square charbagh or mughal garden the garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into sunken parterres or flowerbeds halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is raised marble water tank with reflecting pool positioned on north south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum the elevated marble water tank is called al hawd al kawthar in reference to the tank of abundance promised to muhammad elsewhere the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains the charbagh garden design inspired by persian gardens was introduced to india by babur the first mughal emperor it symbolises the four flowing rivers of jannah paradise and reflects the paradise garden derived from the persian paridaeza meaning walled garden in mystic islamic texts of the mughal period paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from central spring or mountain separating the garden into north west south and east most mughal charbaghs are rectangular with tomb or pavilion in the centre the taj mahal garden is unusual in that the main element the tomb is located at the end of the garden with the discovery of mahtab bagh or moonlight garden on the other side of the yamuna the interpretation of the archaeological survey of india is that the yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden is design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of paradise similarities in layout and architectural features with the shalimar gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect ali mardan early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation including abundant roses daffodils and fruit trees as the mughal empire declined the taj mahal and its gardens also declined by the end of the century the british empire controlled more than three fifths of india and assumed management of the taj mahal they changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of london outlying buildings the taj mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls the side facing the river is open outside the walls are several additional mausoleums including those of shah jahan is other wives and larger tomb for mumtaz is favourite servant the main gateway darwaza is monumental structure built primarily of marble and reminiscent of the mughal architecture of earlier emperors its archways mirror the shape of the tomb is archways and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb the vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex at the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other and face the sides of the tomb the backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls the western building is mosque and the other is the jawab answer thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as guesthouse distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab is lack of mihrab niche in mosque is wall facing mecca and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of prayer rugs in black marble the mosque is basic design of long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by shah jahan particularly the masjid jah num or jama masjid delhi the mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side at the taj mahal each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome the outlying buildings were completed in construction the taj mahal is built on parcel of land to the south of the walled city of agra shah jahan presented maharajah jai singh with large palace in the centre of agra in exchange for the land an area of roughly hectares acres was excavated filled with dirt to reduce seepage and levelled at metres ft above riverbank in the tomb area wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb instead of lashed bamboo workmen constructed colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb the scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle the taj mahal was constructed using materials from all over india and asia it is believed over elephants were used to transport building materials it took the efforts of labourers painters embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the taj mahal the translucent white marble was brought from makrana rajasthan the jasper from punjab jade and crystal from china the turquoise was from tibet and the lapis lazuli from afghanistan while the sapphire came from sri lanka and the carnelian from arabia in all twenty eight types of precious and semi precious stones were inlaid into the white marble according to the legend shah jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight mi tamped earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons an elaborate post and beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position water was drawn from the river by series of purs an animal powered rope and bucket mechanism into large storage tank and raised to large distribution tank it was passed into three subsidiary tanks from which it was piped to the complex the plinth and tomb took roughly years to complete the remaining parts of the complex took an additional years and were completed in order of minarets mosque and jawab and gateway since the complex was built in stages discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on completion construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by while work on the outlying buildings continued for years estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time the total cost at the time has been estimated to be about million indian rupees which is around billion indian rupees million us based on values later days abdul hamid lahauri in his book badshahnama refers to taj mahal as rauza munawwara perso arabic rawdah munawwarah meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb soon after the taj mahal is completion shah jahan was deposed by his son aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby agra fort upon shah jahan is death aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife in the century the jat rulers of bharatpur invaded agra and attacked the taj mahal the two chandeliers one of agate and another of silver which were hung over the main cenotaph were taken away by them along with the gold and silver screen kanbo mughal historian said the gold shield which covered the ft finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the jat despoliation by the late century parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair at the end of the century british viceroy lord curzon ordered sweeping restoration project which was completed in he also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber modelled after one in cairo mosque during this time the garden was remodelled with european style lawns that are still in place today threats in the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the japanese air force during the india pakistan wars of and scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots more recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the yamuna river including acid rain due to the mathura oil refinery which was opposed by supreme court of india directives the pollution has been turning the taj mahal yellow brown to help control the pollution the indian government has set up the taj trapezium zone ttz sq mi area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place concerns for the tomb is structural integrity have recently been raised because of decline in the groundwater level in the yamuna river basin which is falling at rate of around ft per year in cracks appeared in parts of the tomb and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water it has been pointed out by politicians however that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake in it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by storm on april on may another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex tourism the taj mahal attracts large number of tourists unesco documented more than million visitors in which had increased to about million in two tier pricing system is in place with significantly lower entrance fee for indian citizens and more expensive one for foreigners in the fee for indian citizens was inr for foreign tourists inr most tourists visit in the cooler months of october november and february polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus the khawasspuras northern courtyards are currently being restored for use as new visitor centre in in order to address overtourism the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours the small town to the south of the taj known as taj ganji or mumtazabad was initially constructed with caravanserais bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the taj mahal which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world including the recently announced new seven wonders of the world recent poll with million votes the grounds are open from to weekdays except for friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between and the complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after excluding fridays and the month of ramadan foreign dignitaries often visit the taj mahal on trips to india notable figures who have travelled to the site include dwight eisenhower jacqueline kennedy jimmy carter george bush george harrison barack and michelle obama mark zuckerberg vladimir putin princess diana and donald trump myths ever since its construction the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument longstanding myth holds that shah jahan planned mausoleum to be built in black marble as black taj mahal across the yamuna river the idea originates from fanciful writings of jean baptiste tavernier european traveller who visited agra in it was suggested that his son aurangzeb overthrew shah jahan before it could be built ruins of blackened marble across the river in moonlight garden mahtab bagh seemed to support this legend however excavations carried out in the found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the moonlight garden dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen befitting shah jahan is obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself warrior empire the mughals of india television network evidence exists for claims that describe often in horrific detail the deaths dismemberments and mutilations which shah jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design similar claims are made for many famous buildings no evidence exists for claims that lord william bentinck governor general of india in the supposedly planned to demolish the taj mahal and auction off the marble bentinck is biographer john rosselli says that the story arose from bentinck is fund raising sale of discarded marble from agra fort another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth to this day officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette in india is supreme court dismissed oak is petition to declare that hindu king built the taj mahal in similar petition was dismissed by the allahabad high court this case was brought by amar nath mishra social worker and preacher who says that the taj mahal was built by the hindu king parmar dev in theory that the taj mahal was designed by an italian geronimo vereneo held sway for brief period after it was first promoted by henry george keene in who went by translation of spanish work itinerario the travels of fray sebastian manrique another theory that frenchman austin of bordeaux designed the taj was promoted by william henry sleeman based on the work of jean baptiste tavernier these ideas were revived by father hosten and discussed again by havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies controversies as of several court cases about taj mahal being hindu temple have been inspired by oak is theory in august archaeological survey of india asi stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed temple bharatiya janata party is vinay katiyar in claimed that the century monument was built by mughal emperor shah jahan after destroying hindu temple called tejo mahalaya and it housed shiva linga this claim had also been made by another bjp member laxmikant bajpai in the bjp government is union minister of culture mahesh sharma stated in november during session of the parliament that there was no evidence that it was temple the theories about taj mahal being shiva temple started circulating when oak released his book taj mahal the true story he claimed it was built in ad and not in the century as stated by the asi samajwadi party leader azam khan stated taj might be destroyed like babri masjid as people believed there was temple there katiyar called for the demolition of the taj and its replacement by temple in february in response indian national congress mp shashi tharoor called him troglodyte controversy was created in when the uttar pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet uttar pradesh tourism unlimited possibilities the chief minister yogi adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent indian culture amidst this controversy bjp mla sangeet som had claimed that the those who built the taj mahal were traitors and it was blot on the country is culture he claimed it was built by man who jailed his own father and wished to kill hindus bjp mp anshul verma supported his comments aimim mp asaduddin owaisi jammu kashmir national conference leader omar abdullah and azam khan criticised him

placed at its corners which replicate the onion shape of the main dome the dome is slightly asymmetrical their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior tall decorative spires guldastas extend from edges of base walls and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome the lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas the dome and chattris are topped by gilded finial which mixes traditional persian and hindustani decorative elements the main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by copy made of gilded bronze in the early century this feature provides clear example of integration of traditional persian and hindu decorative elements the finial is topped by moon typical islamic motif whose horns point heavenward the minarets which are each more than metres ft tall display the designer is penchant for symmetry they were designed as working minarets traditional element of mosques used by the muezzin to call the islamic faithful to prayer each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower at the top of the tower is final balcony surmounted by chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb the chattris all share the same decorative elements of lotus design topped by gilded finial the minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb exterior decorations the exterior decorations of the taj mahal are among the finest in mughal architecture as the surface area changes the decorations are refined proportionally the decorative elements were created by applying paint stucco stone inlays or carvings in line with the islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy abstract forms or vegetative motifs throughout the complex are passages from the qur an that comprise some of the decorative elements recent scholarship suggests that amanat khan chose the passages the calligraphy on the great gate reads soul thou art at rest return to the lord at peace with him and he at peace with you the calligraphy was created in by calligrapher named abdul haq shah jahan conferred the title of amanat khan upon him as reward for his dazzling virtuosity near the lines from the qur an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription written by the insignificant being amanat khan shirazi much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below the calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate abstract forms are used throughout especially in the plinth minarets gateway mosque jawab and to lesser extent on the surfaces of the tomb the domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements white inlays are used in sandstone buildings and dark or black inlays on the white marbles mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in contrasting colour which creates complex array of geometric patterns floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns on the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines the marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings the dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised almost geometric vines flowers and fruits the inlay stones are of yellow marble jasper and jade polished and levelled to the surface of the walls interior decoration the interior chamber of the taj mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements the inlay work is not pietra dura but lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones the inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face although only the door facing the garden to the south is used the interior walls are about metres ft high and are topped by false interior dome decorated with sun motif eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and as with the exterior each lower pishtaq is crowned by second pishtaq about midway up the wall the four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas and each balcony is exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble in addition to the light from the balcony screens light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners the octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work the remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi precious stones forming twining vines fruits and flowers each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas relief intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect in little detail the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves hence the bodies of mumtaz and shah jahan were put in relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right towards mecca mumtaz mahal is cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on rectangular marble base of by metres ft in by ft in both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise mumtaz on the lid of the casket is raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest writing tablet shah jahan is cenotaph is beside mumtaz is to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex his cenotaph is bigger than his wife is but reflects the same elements larger casket on slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him on the lid of the casket is traditional sculpture of small pen box the pen box and writing tablet are traditional mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively the ninety nine names of god are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of mumtaz mahal other inscriptions inside the crypt include noble magnificent majestic unique eternal glorious the tomb of shah jahan bears calligraphic inscription that reads he travelled from this world to the banquet hall of eternity on the night of the twenty sixth of the month of rajab in the year hijri garden the complex is set around large ft square charbagh or mughal garden the garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into sunken parterres or flowerbeds halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is raised marble water tank with reflecting pool positioned on north south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum the elevated marble water tank is called al hawd al kawthar in reference to the tank of abundance promised to muhammad elsewhere the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains the charbagh garden design inspired by persian gardens was introduced to india by babur the first mughal emperor it symbolises the four flowing rivers of jannah paradise and reflects the paradise garden derived from the persian paridaeza meaning walled garden in mystic islamic texts of the mughal period paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from central spring or mountain separating the garden into north west south and east most mughal charbaghs are rectangular with tomb or pavilion in the centre the taj mahal garden is unusual in that the main element the tomb is located at the end of the garden with the discovery of mahtab bagh or moonlight garden on the other side of the yamuna the interpretation of the archaeological survey of india is that the yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden is design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of paradise similarities in layout and architectural features with the shalimar gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect ali mardan early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation including abundant roses daffodils and fruit trees as the mughal empire declined the taj mahal and its gardens also declined by the end of the century the british empire controlled more than three fifths of india and assumed management of the taj mahal they changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of london outlying buildings the taj mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls the side facing the river is open outside the walls are several additional mausoleums including those of shah jahan is other wives and larger tomb for mumtaz is favourite servant the main gateway darwaza is monumental structure built primarily of marble and reminiscent of the mughal architecture of earlier emperors its archways mirror the shape of the tomb is archways and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb the vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex at the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other and face the sides of the tomb the backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls the western building is mosque and the other is the jawab answer thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as guesthouse distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab is lack of mihrab niche in mosque is wall facing mecca and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of prayer rugs in black marble the mosque is basic design of long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by shah jahan particularly the masjid jah num or jama masjid delhi the mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side at the taj mahal each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome the outlying buildings were completed in construction the taj mahal is built on parcel of land to the south of the walled city of agra shah jahan presented maharajah jai singh with large palace in the centre of agra in exchange for the land an area of roughly hectares acres was excavated filled with dirt to reduce seepage and levelled at metres ft above riverbank in the tomb area wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb instead of lashed bamboo workmen constructed colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb the scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle the taj mahal was constructed using materials from all over india and asia it is believed over elephants were used to transport building materials it took the efforts of labourers painters embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the taj mahal the translucent white marble was brought from makrana rajasthan the jasper from punjab jade and crystal from china the turquoise was from tibet and the lapis lazuli from afghanistan while the sapphire came from sri lanka and the carnelian from arabia in all twenty eight types of precious and semi precious stones were inlaid into the white marble according to the legend shah jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight mi tamped earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons an elaborate post and beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position water was drawn from the river by series of purs an animal powered rope and bucket mechanism into large storage tank and raised to large distribution tank it was passed into three subsidiary tanks from which it was piped to the complex the plinth and tomb took roughly years to complete the remaining parts of the complex took an additional years and were completed in order of minarets mosque and jawab and gateway since the complex was built in stages discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on completion construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by while work on the outlying buildings continued for years estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time the total cost at the time has been estimated to be about million indian rupees which is around billion indian rupees million us based on values later days abdul hamid lahauri in his book badshahnama refers to taj mahal as rauza munawwara perso arabic rawdah munawwarah meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb soon after the taj mahal is completion shah jahan was deposed by his son aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby agra fort upon shah jahan is death aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife in the century the jat rulers of bharatpur invaded agra and attacked the taj mahal the two chandeliers one of agate and another of silver which were hung over the main cenotaph were taken away by them along with the gold and silver screen kanbo mughal historian said the gold shield which covered the ft finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the jat despoliation by the late century parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair at the end of the century british viceroy lord curzon ordered sweeping restoration project which was completed in he also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber modelled after one in cairo mosque during this time the garden was remodelled with european style lawns that are still in place today threats in the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the japanese air force during the india pakistan wars of and scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots more recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the yamuna river including acid rain due to the mathura oil refinery which was opposed by supreme court of india directives the pollution has been turning the taj mahal yellow brown to help control the pollution the indian government has set up the taj trapezium zone ttz sq mi area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place concerns for the tomb is structural integrity have recently been raised because of decline in the groundwater level in the yamuna river basin which is falling at rate of around ft per year in cracks appeared in parts of the tomb and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water it has been pointed out by politicians however that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake in it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by storm on april on may another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex tourism the taj mahal attracts large number of tourists unesco documented more than million visitors in which had increased to about million in two tier pricing system is in place with significantly lower entrance fee for indian citizens and more expensive one for foreigners in the fee for indian citizens was inr for foreign tourists inr most tourists visit in the cooler months of october november and february polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus the khawasspuras northern courtyards are currently being restored for use as new visitor centre in in order to address overtourism the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours the small town to the south of the taj known as taj ganji or mumtazabad was initially constructed with caravanserais bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the taj mahal which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world including the recently announced new seven wonders of the world recent poll with million votes the grounds are open from to weekdays except for friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between and the complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after excluding fridays and the month of ramadan foreign dignitaries often visit the taj mahal on trips to india notable figures who have travelled to the site include dwight eisenhower jacqueline kennedy jimmy carter george bush george harrison barack and michelle obama mark zuckerberg vladimir putin princess diana and donald trump myths ever since its construction the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument longstanding myth holds that shah jahan planned mausoleum to be built in black marble as black taj mahal across the yamuna river the idea originates from fanciful writings of jean baptiste tavernier european traveller who visited agra in it was suggested that his son aurangzeb overthrew shah jahan before it could be built ruins of blackened marble across the river in moonlight garden mahtab bagh seemed to support this legend however excavations carried out in the found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the moonlight garden dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen befitting shah jahan is obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself warrior empire the mughals of india television network evidence exists for claims that describe often in horrific detail the deaths dismemberments and mutilations which shah jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design similar claims are made for many famous buildings no evidence exists for claims that lord william bentinck governor general of india in the supposedly planned to demolish the taj mahal and auction off the marble bentinck is biographer john rosselli says that the story arose from bentinck is fund raising sale of discarded marble from agra fort another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth to this day officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette in india is supreme court dismissed oak is petition to declare that hindu king built the taj mahal in similar petition was dismissed by the allahabad high court this case was brought by amar nath mishra social worker and preacher who says that the taj mahal was built by the hindu king parmar dev in theory that the taj mahal was designed by an italian geronimo vereneo held sway for brief period after it was first promoted by henry george keene in who went by translation of spanish work itinerario the travels of fray sebastian manrique another theory that frenchman austin of bordeaux designed the taj was promoted by william henry sleeman based on the work of jean baptiste tavernier these ideas were revived by father hosten and discussed again by havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies controversies as of several court cases about taj mahal being hindu temple have been inspired by oak is theory in august archaeological survey of india asi stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed temple bharatiya janata party is vinay katiyar in claimed that the century monument was built by mughal emperor shah jahan after destroying hindu temple called tejo mahalaya and it housed shiva linga this claim had also been made by another bjp member laxmikant bajpai in the bjp government is union minister of culture mahesh sharma stated in november during session of the parliament that there was no evidence that it was temple the theories about taj mahal being shiva temple started circulating when oak released his book taj mahal the true story he claimed it was built in ad and not in the century as stated by the asi samajwadi party leader azam khan stated taj might be destroyed like babri masjid as people believed there was temple there katiyar called for the demolition of the taj and its replacement by temple in february in response indian national congress mp shashi tharoor called him troglodyte controversy was created in when the uttar pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet uttar pradesh tourism unlimited possibilities the chief minister yogi adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent indian culture amidst this controversy bjp mla sangeet som had claimed that the those who built the taj mahal were traitors and it was blot on the country is culture he claimed it was built by man who jailed his own father and wished to kill hindus bjp mp anshul verma supported his comments aimim mp asaduddin owaisi jammu kashmir national conference leader omar abdullah and azam khan criticised him
